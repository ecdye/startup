## AWS Notes

My domain is [ecdye.click](https://ecdye.click) which renews at $3 a year with ~$.50 a month for hosting.
Caddy is using Lets Encrypt to generate a free certificate and make it so we don't have to worry about manually configuring it.


## HTML Notes

Good reference for input types in HTML is [here](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/html/input/input.md#html-input-elements)

## CSS Notes

I thought about using Tailwind as I have a little bit of experience with it but ended up choosing to use bootstrap with a small amount of additional styling for things like the wheel. I made this choice primarily to stretch myself and learn something new.
